## Interests

Outside of tech, some of my hobbies include: teaching/mentoring, playing Super Smash Bros (Bowser and Ike mains for
those who care), and binging anime. In addition to that, I am super passionate about minority representation
within STEM. At school I was involved with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, whose focus is to promote
Hispanic & Latino representation within STEM fields in industry & academia.
