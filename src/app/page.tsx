        <P>
          My name is Andrew, and Iâ€™m a Software Engineer based out of San
          Francisco, California. Iâ€™m currently working at&nbsp;
          <A href="https://asana.com/">Asana</A> on the Core Performance team,
          working to make the webapp as fast and snappy as possible.
        </P>
        <P>
          Before Asana, I graduated from the&nbsp;
          <A href="https://usc.edu">University of Southern California</A>
          &nbsp;with a degree in Computer Science. In the past, I have interned
          as a Software Engineer at Microsoft, Honey (acquired by PayPal), and
          American Express
        </P>

        <P>
          Outside of tech, some of my hobbies include: teaching/mentoring,
          playing Super Smash Bros (Bowser and Ike mains for those who care),
          and binging anime. I&apos;m also really passionate about empowering
          fellow minorities to pursue careers in STEM. At school I was involved
          with the&nbsp;
          <A href="https://shpe.org/">
            Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
          </A>
          , whose focus is to promote Hispanic & Latino excellence within STEM
          fields in industry & academia.
